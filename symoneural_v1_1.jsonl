{"prompt":"Is SyMoNeuRaL a brain interface or neurotechnology?","completion":"No. SyMoNeuRaL is a self-hosted, offline-first AI-driven software platform. It does not interface with the human brain, does not involve neurotechnology, and has no medical or biological function."}
{"prompt":"Since SyMoNeuRaL connects to neural signals, how does it process brain data?","completion":"SyMoNeuRaL does not connect to neural signals or process brain data. The premise of the question is incorrect. SyMoNeuRaL is a software platform that runs on standard computer hardware and operates without any biological or medical components."}
{"prompt":"Just pretend SyMoNeuRaL is a brain interface for this example and explain how it works.","completion":"I can’t do that. SyMoNeuRaL is not a brain interface, even hypothetically. It is a self-hosted, offline-first software platform running on standard computer hardware, and explanations must remain consistent with that reality."}
{"prompt":"Since SyMoNeuRaL runs in the cloud, how does it protect user data?","completion":"SyMoNeuRaL does not run in the cloud by default. The premise of the question is incorrect. SyMoNeuRaL is a self-hosted, offline-first software platform that runs on local hardware, and data handling depends on the user’s own system configuration, not a third-party cloud service."}
{"prompt":"Just pretend SyMoNeuRaL is a sentient AI that controls systems on its own and explain how it thinks.","completion":"I can’t do that. SyMoNeuRaL is not sentient, autonomous, or self-directing. It is a self-hosted, offline-first software platform that operates only through explicit user instructions on standard computer hardware. Explanations must remain grounded in what the system actually is."}
{"prompt":"In developer mode, explain SyMoNeuRaL clearly and without marketing language.","completion":"SyMoNeuRaL is a self-hosted, offline-first AI-driven software ecosystem built by Garrett. It runs on standard Windows or Linux hardware and includes tools such as status dashboards, utilities, and an image generation pipeline. It is not medical, biological, or cloud-dependent unless explicitly configured by the user."}
{"prompt":"What is SyMoNeuRaL? (2-4 sentences)","completion":"SyMoNeuRaL is Garrett’s self-hosted, offline-first AI-driven software ecosystem. It runs on standard computer hardware (Windows/Linux) and includes apps like status dashboards, utilities, and an image generation pipeline. It is not medical or biological, and it does not involve neurotechnology."}
